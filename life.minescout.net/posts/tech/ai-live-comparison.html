                    <div class="post-content">
                        <h2>What is this</h2>
                        <p>Have you ever wanted to just place your phone down and talk? Nowadays, AIs have started
                            gaining live features, where you can talk in a conversation-like manner. Our goal is to test
                            the capabilities of them all, and give them each an overall grade of 1-10. The different
                            things we will test are music, where I will hum “Rewrite the Stars”, then we will see if it
                            has any special features, and then talk to it as if I were packing for a trip. We will be
                            testing ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Meta, and Grok. All tests will be done on the phone app
                            to keep things consistent.</p>

                        <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
                        <p>Starting with ChatGPT, we can see that it can talk live on the web and on the phone app.
                            Looking into the different features that this AI live mode has, you can see that it can mute
                            and change voices, but nothing else. When using the live feature, I told it what I was going
                            to do and then sang the lyrics. When you are done with the chat, it transcribes what it
                            heard. The problem is that the transcription is not that good, which you can see from below.
                            Another thing that is weird is that it sounds as if it is rushing through what it is trying
                            to say. When I asked it about a 4-day trip to NYC, it gave me a good list of items to bring,
                            but yet again, it seemed as if it was trying to race through the list. Overall, I give the
                            AI live mode a 7/10, as while it works, it lacks features that the other AIs have, and
                            doesn’t sound great.</p>

                        <img src="../images/ai-live-comp-image/ChatGPT Packing.png" alt="ChatGPT Packing List">

                        <h2>Gemini</h2>
                        <p>Moving on to the Gemini, you are only able to use it on the phone app as of now. With that,
                            it has more features than ChatGPT does. For example, it allows you to pause the
                            conversation, unlike ChatGPT, which only allows muting. It also gives camera and screenshare
                            options. One feature that it misses out on is transcribing what is said. When taking what
                            you have said, it will act like voice to text, missing words and changing them entirely, but
                            Gemini manages to understand what is being said. When I go into live and tell it what it is
                            going to do, it says it's up for the challenge, unlike ChatGPT, which came before. It also
                            managed to give a quick and correct answer. When I ask if it's sure, it gives me the lyrics
                            to prove itself. When you listen to Gemini’s voice, it sounds much more human-like, just in
                            the way that it flows through the sentence. When I go on to ask about the NYC trip, it gives
                            me a weather summary, as well as a couple of must-have clothing items. While the list was
                            not as detailed, it gave me what I needed to pack as I asked. I give this a 9.5/10 because
                            while it works, it is missing the ability to access google acount information, like email or
                            calendar while in live mode, but it can access generic weather information. This is planned
                            to change in the coming months, and I should create an update on this.</p>

                        <img src="../images/ai-live-comp-image/Gemini Packing.png" alt="Gemini Packing List">

                        <h2>Perplexity</h2>
                        <p>Next up is Perplexity. It is not as well-known as the previous two AIs, but it is good
                            nonetheless. One thing that it offers is video and screen share, just like Gemini. However,
                            it transcribes what it is saying under the live icon. The only bad thing is that, unlike
                            ChatGPT, which transcribes the audio, it will take a little of what is said and will make it
                            into the prompt, as you can see above. When I started the live feature and told it what I
                            was going to do, it said that it couldn’t find the name from singing, but when I sang it
                            anyway, it managed to find the correct song and movie, as well as give citations as to where
                            it found them. When I asked it what I should pack on a 4-day trip to NYC, it gave me fewer
                            items than ChatGPT and Gemini. However, it gave me a great idea on what to start packing,
                            and if you're like me, you will ask how you are doing. Overall, I give this AI an 8.5/10,
                            because while it does have a good voice and speed, it struggles to understand everything you
                            say, and doesn’t like to be interrupted. Also, some of the camera and screen features will
                            not work once it starts talking, unlike Gemini.</p>

                        <img src="../images/ai-live-comp-image/Perplexity Packing.png" alt="Perplexity Packing List">

                        <h2>Meta</h2>
                        <p>Up next is Meta, which has many cool features. Like ChatGPT, Meta can be talked to live on
                            both the phone app and website. It is missing out on camera and screenshare features; it is
                            embedded in Meta AI glasses. Another feature that Meta has is that it is testing a
                            Full-duplex demo live mode, which I did not use. Starting in live mode, I told it what the
                            plan was, and it said that it was ready. When I talked, it gave a small caption with what I
                            was saying, and gave a caption on what it was saying when it was talking. Overall, the
                            transcription is one of the best of all the ones we had tested by this point. It ended up
                            correctly classifying the song and the show it was from. When I asked it about what to pack
                            on the NYC trip, it understood the month was June and gave me a good list of items to pack
                            for the trip. Overall, I give Meta AI a 7.5/10. I give it this rating because it is not
                            quite human-like interactions, and it likes to interrupt you and forget the conversation
                            when you continue talking.</p>

                        <img src="../images/ai-live-comp-image/Meta Packing.png" alt="Meta Packing List">

                        <h2>Grok</h2>
                        <p>Finally, Grok. Grok took the longest time to connect to live mode, but it has a lot of
                            different “modes” you can use. Grok's transcription was better than others, but still lacked
                            in time, as it managed to duplicate me singing and still get the song wrong. Grok also only
                            has two voice options, which really limits people with high and low voice sensitivity. While
                            Grok AI is planned to be implemented in many different areas in the tech industry, it
                            doesn’t quite seem ready to be there. When I ask Grok about my NYC trip, it gives a very
                            brief and wide description of what I should pack. Overall, I give Grok a 3.5/10, as it
                            struggles to understand and or check its answers, as well as being the longest to get to.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
                        <p>Overall, first is Gemini, followed by Perplexity, then Meta, then ChatGPT, and lastly Grok.
                            Thanks for reading!!</p>
