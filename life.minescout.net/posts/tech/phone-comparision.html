                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Have you ever debated about what phone to get? You probably had to choose between IOS and
                            Android. With better customizability, less cost, and a larger model test range, Android is
                            the way to go.</p>

                        <h2>Software</h2>
                        <p>Android software is better as it is more customizable than IOS software. As there is more
                            customizability, more people can have the layout they prefer on Android software compared to
                            the strict and harsh environment of IOS. An example of this would be for widgets; Android
                            allows a much more diverse placement and sizing, while IOS has few options for placement on
                            screen. Android gives people the option on how they want their phone to run. You can see
                            this in the fact that Apple iPhones are only allowed to run IOS, and give no easy way to run
                            a different launchers, while Android encourages people to use different launchers for a
                            better community. As you can now see, Android gives people a much easier and simplistic way
                            to customize their phones, while IOS wants to keep you in their ecosystem.</p>

                        <h2>Ecosystem/Cost</h2>
                        <p>Speaking of ecosystems, if you want to get into a cheap and easy software sphere, Android is
                            the place to look. As Android phones cost less, more people get hands on new technology,
                            which help to spreed the word of different companies. IOS is a single company group, with a
                            much pricier environment. One example of this is in the Pixel lineup, which include built in
                            thermometers, with a free and easy to use app pre installed. Apple phones, like to keep to a
                            tried and tested theory and wait until they know it will help them. With word spreed of many
                            companies, Android tends to have a much larger community, for beta testing and project
                            development. As IOS is a single large company, it has a much smaller but loyal group for
                            testing. This is made clear when you see the improvement that Android makes in the time that
                            IOS takes to make a update. With these details, you can see that Android can make and fix
                            issues in a much faster pase than good OLD reliable IOS.</p>

                        <h2>Push the Limits</h2>
                        <p>With multiple large Android phone companies, there are more models of phones that run Android
                            than IOS. With this larger model range, Android can have phones focused on certain aspects,
                            while IOS has to be the middle ground for most of them. An example of this is the OnePlus
                            13. This phone is in a large part focused on its camera. While IOS phones have good cameras,
                            many Android phones run better software and touchup features. Another example would be the
                            Nothing CMF Phone 1. This phone, while cheap, focuses entirely on its customizability. This
                            phone allows you to add accessories just be screwing and unscrewing screws. With only these
                            2 examples, you can see how much Android can focus on one area for their phones, and how
                            this allows them a broader audience.</p>

                        <h2>Larger Range of Devices</h2>
                        <p>With this larger user group, Android is not afraid to push the limits of what phones can do.
                            While IOS is made to be reliable and fit in with their ecosystem, Android phones push their
                            hardware to the max, even if software to run it has not been fully developed. One example of
                            this is RedMagic 9s Pro; this phone is designed to play heavy-duty games that IOS would
                            wither in playing. Just this one feature, makes IOS look like a hard choice for the common
                            gamer. While IOS might put off people in that moment, they will often implement these
                            features in new generations. IOS likes to make sure that whatever they implement, people
                            will enjoy. For this reason, if something new comes out on Android, IOS will wait a little
                            before considering adding it. But during this time Android will always have something new.
                            One example of this is spilt-screen; Android had started to feature this a couple of years
                            before IOS even thought of it. All in all, Android will push the limits, IOS will follow
                            behind.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>With these examples given above, you can see how Android over takes IOS in multiple areas.
                            Even thought IOS and Android are always evolving, Android, with its larger group of beta
                            testers, will often have the quicker speed. I hope that this information sways your mind (
                            you IOS users >:{ ) to use Android.</p>
